<p><txt>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</txt></p>

<txt>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</txt>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1 (32 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
    <li>32 ounces cottage cheese</li>
    <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>

</ul>    
<h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Combine cottage cheese, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, eggs, 1/2 of the grated Parmesan cheese, dried parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
    <li>Spread 3/4 cup of sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 3 uncooked lasagna noodles, 1 3/4 cups of cheese mixture, and 1/4 cup sauce; repeat layers once more. Top with remaining 3 noodles, sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. Pour 1/2 cup water along the edges of the dish. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
