    <p><txt>Making homemade lemonade is probably way easier than you think (and it's well worth the extra effort). You'll just need to follow a few simple steps.</txt></p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p><ul>
    <li>1 ¾ cups white sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>9 medium lemons, or more as needed</li>
    <li>7 cups ice-cold water</li>
    <li>ice as needed</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Cooking Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li>Combine sugar and 1 cup water in a small saucepan. Stir to dissolve sugar while mixture comes to a boil. Set aside to cool slightly.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, roll lemons around on your counter to soften. Cut in half lengthwise, and squeeze into a liquid measuring cup. Add pulp to the juice, but discard any seeds. Continue juicing until you have 1 1/2 cups fresh juice and pulp.</li>
<li>Pour 7 cups ice-cold water into a pitcher. Stir in lemon juice and pulp, then add simple syrup to taste. Add ice.</li>
</ol>
